    journal = {Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics},
    abstract = {We present GRAMSES, a new pipeline for nonlinear cosmological N-body simulations in General Relativity (GR). This code adopts the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner (ADM) formalism of GR, with constant mean curvature and minimum distortion gauge fixings, which provides a fully nonlinear and background independent framework for relativistic cosmology. Employing a fully constrained formulation, the Einstein equations are reduced to a set of ten elliptical equations which are solved using multigrid relaxation with adaptive mesh refinements (AMR), and three hyperbolic equations for the evolution of tensor degrees of freedom. The current version of GRAMSES neglects the latter by using the conformal flatness approximation, which allows it to compute the two scalar and two vector degrees of freedom of the metric. In this paper we describe the methodology, implementation, code tests and first results for cosmological simulations in a ΛCDM universe, while the generation of initial conditions and physical results will be discussed elsewhere. Inheriting the efficient AMR and massive parallelisation infrastructure from the publicly-available N-body and hydrodynamic simulation code RAMSES, GRAMSES is ideal for studying the detailed behaviour of spacetime inside virialised cosmic structures and hence accurately quantifying the impact of backreaction effects on the cosmic expansion, as well as for investigating GR effects on cosmological observables using cosmic-volume simulations.}

represented by Extended Theories of Gravity. The approach consists in addressing
issues like dark components from the point of view of gravitational field
instead of requiring new material ingredients that, up to now, have not been
detected at fundamental level. In this review paper, by extending the
Hilbert-Einstein action of gravitational field to more general actions (e.g.
f(R) gravity), it is shown that several gravitating structures like stars,
spiral galaxies, elliptical galaxies and clusters of galaxies can be
self-consistently described without asking for dark matter. It is also shown
that standard General Relativity tests and Equivalence Principle constraints can
be evaded at Solar System scales.},

    cosmological background of massive neutrinos – with the aim to investigate
    their possible observational degeneracies. We focus on three basic
    statistics of the large-scale matter distribution, more specifically the
    non-linear matter power spectrum, the halo mass function, and the halo bias.
    Our results show that while these two extended models separately determine
    very prominent and potentially detectable features in all the three
    statistics, when we allow them to be simultaneously at work these features
    are strongly suppressed. In particular, when an f (R) gravity model with
    fR0 = −1 × 10−4 is combined with a total neutrino mass of Σimνi = 0.4 eV,
    the resulting matter power spectrum, halo mass function, and bias at z = 0
    are found to be consistent with the standard model's predictions at
    the ≲10, ≲20, and ≲5 per cent accuracy levels, respectively. Therefore, our
    results imply an intrinsic theoretical limit to the effective discriminating

    hydrodynamics (SPH). Our implementation of SPH manifestly conserves energy
    and entropy in regions free of dissipation, while allowing for fully
    adaptive smoothing lengths. Gravitational forces are computed with a
    hierarchical multipole expansion, which can optionally be applied in the
    form of a TreePM algorithm, where only short-range forces are computed with
    the ‘tree’ method while long-range forces are determined with Fourier
    techniques. Time integration is based on a quasi-symplectic scheme where
    long-range and short-range forces can be integrated with different
    time-steps. Individual and adaptive short-range time-steps may also be
    employed. The domain decomposition used in the parallelization algorithm is
    based on a space-filling curve, resulting in high flexibility and tree force
    errors that do not depend on the way the domains are cut. The code is
    efficient in terms of memory consumption and required communication
    bandwidth. It has been used to compute the first cosmological N-body
    simulation with more than 1010 dark matter particles, reaching a homogeneous
    spatial dynamic range of 105 per dimension in a three-dimensional box. It
    has also been used to carry out very large cosmological SPH simulations that
    account for radiative cooling and star formation, reaching total particle
    numbers of more than 250 million. We present the algorithms used by the code

    comparing with the Newtonian N-body codes Gadget-2 and RAMSES. We then
    proceed with a simulation of large scale structure in a Universe with
    massive neutrinos where we study the gravitational slip induced by the
    neutrino shear stress.  The code can be extended to include different kinds

    to conventional sources of energy–momentum. We then address three broad
    methods of addressing an accelerating universe: the introduction of a
    cosmological constant, its problems and origins; the possibility of dark
    energy and the associated challenges for fundamental physics and the option
    that an infrared modification of general relativity may be responsible for
    the large-scale behavior of the universe.}

    abstract={We review some recent developments in the conformal gravity theory
    that has been advanced as a candidate alternative to standard Einstein
    gravity. As a quantum theory the conformal theory is both renormalizable and
    unitary, with unitarity being obtained because the theory is a PT symmetric
    rather than a Hermitian theory. We show that in the theory there can be no a
    priori classical curvature, with all curvature having to result from
    quantization. In the conformal theory gravity requires no independent
    quantization of its own, with it being quantized solely by virtue of its
    being coupled to a quantized matter source. Moreover, because it is this
    very coupling that fixes the strength of the gravitational field
    commutators, the gravity sector zero-point energy density and pressure
    fluctuations are then able to identically cancel the zero-point fluctuations
    associated with the matter sector. In addition, we show that when the
    conformal symmetry is spontaneously broken, the zero-point structure
    automatically readjusts so as to identically cancel the cosmological
    constant term that dynamical mass generation induces. We show that the
    macroscopic classical theory that results from the quantum conformal theory
    incorporates global physics effects that provide for a detailed accounting
    of a comprehensive set of 138 galactic rotation curves with no adjustable
    parameters other than the galactic mass to light ratios, and with the need
    for no dark matter whatsoever. With these global effects eliminating the
    need for dark matter, we see that invoking dark matter in galaxies could
    potentially be nothing more than an attempt to describe global physics
    effects in purely local galactic terms. Finally, we review some recent work
    by 't Hooft in which a connection between conformal gravity and Einstein
    gravity has been found.},

    abstract={Future astronomical surveys will gather information that will allow 
    gravity to be tested on cosmological scales, where general relativity is 
    currently poorly constrained. We present a set of cosmological 
    hydrodynamical simulations that follow galaxy formation in $f(R)$ 
    modified gravity models and are dedicated to finding observational 
    signatures to help distinguish general relativity from alternatives 
    using this information. The simulations employ the IllustrisTNG model 
    and a new modified gravity solver in AREPO, allowing the interplay 
    of baryonic feedback and modified gravity to be studied in the same simulation, 
    and the degeneracy between them in the matter power spectrum to be resolved. 
    We find that the neutral hydrogen power spectrum is suppressed substantially 
    in $f(R)$ gravity, which allows this model to be constrained using 
    upcoming data from the Square Kilometre Array. 
    Disk galaxies can form in our $f(R)$ gravity simulations, 
    even in the partially screened regime, and their galaxy stellar properties 
    are only mildly affected. We conclude that modified gravity 
    allows the formation of realistic galaxies and leaves observable signatures on large scales.},

abstract = "We present in a manifestly gauge-invariant form the theory of
classical linear gravitational perturbations in part I, and a quantum theory of
cosmological perturbations in part II. Part I includes applications to several
important examples arising in cosmology: a univese dominated by hydrodynamical
matter, a universe filled with scalar-field matter, and higher-derivative
theories of gravity. The growth rates of perturbations are calculated
analytically in most interesting cases. The analysis is applied to study the
evolution of fluctuations in inflationary universe models. Part II includes a
unified description of the quantum generation and evolution of inhomogeneities
about a classial Friedmann background. The method is based on standard canonical
quantization of the action for cosmological perturbations which has been reduced
to an expression in terms of a single gauge-invariant variable. The spectrum of
density perturbations originating in quantum fluctuations is calculated in
universe with hydrodynamical matter, in inflationary universe models with
scalar-field matter, and in higher-derivative theories of gravity. The
gauge-invariant theory of classical and quantized cosmological perturbations
developed in parts I and II is applied in part III to several interesting
physical problems. It allows a simple derivation of the relation between
temperature anistropes in the cosmic microwave background. radiation and the
gauge-invariant potential for metric perturbations. The generation and evolution
of gravitational waves is studied. As another example, a simple analysis of
entropy perturbations and non-scale-invariant spectra in inflationary universe
models is presented. The gauge-invariant theory of cosmological perturbations
also allows a consistent and gauge-invariant definition of statistical
fluctuations."
